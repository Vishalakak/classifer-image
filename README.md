Image Classifier using Keras and TensorFlow 🖼️🤖
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classifier built using Keras and TensorFlow. It classifies images into different categories using deep learning techniques.

🚀 Features
Uses CNN architecture for high accuracy.

Trained on the MNIST dataset (Handwritten Digits 0-9).

Supports real-time predictions for new images.

Easy to train and modify for other datasets.

Visualizes predictions using Matplotlib.
